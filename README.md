# Kafka Monitor
Kafka Monitor is a framework to implement and execute long-running kafka
system tests in a real cluster. It complements Kafkaâ€™s existing system
tests by capturing potential bugs or regressions that are only likely to occur
after prolonged period of time or with low probability. Moreover, it allows you to monitor Kafka
cluster using end-to-end pipelines to obtain a number of derived vital stats
such as end-to-end latency, service availability and message loss rate. You can easily
deploy Kafka Monitor to test and monitor your Kafka cluster without requiring
any change to your application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Kafka Monitor requires Gradle 2.0 or higher. Java 7 should be used for
building in order to support both Java 7 and Java 8 at runtime.

### Build Kafka Monitor
```
$ go get github.com/linkedin/kafka-monitor
$ cd kafka-monitor 
$ ./gradlew jar
```

### Start KafkaMonitor to run tests/services specified in the config file
```
$ ./bin/kafka-monitor-start.sh config/kafka-monitor.properties
```

### Run BasicEndToEndTest to monitor kafka cluster
```
$ ./bin/end-to-end-test.sh --topic test --broker-list localhost:9092 --zookeeper localhost:2181
```

### Get metric values (e.g. service availability, message loss rate) in real-time as time series graphs
Open ```localhost:8000/index.html``` in your web browser

You can edit webapp/index.html to easily add new metrics to be displayed.

### Query metric value (e.g. service availability) via HTTP request
```
curl localhost:8778/jolokia/read/kmf.services:type=produce-metrics/produce-availability-avg
```

You can query other JMX metric value as well by substituting object-name and
attribute-name of the JMX metric in the query above.

### Run checkstyle on the java code
```
./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest
```

### Build IDE project
```
./gradlew idea
./gradlew eclipse
```
